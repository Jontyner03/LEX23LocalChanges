Notes and Things that Need to be Done for LPR2:

SCOPE: To start, focus on constructors and append functions for datastructures before moving on
to gdb and memcheck tasks given for lpr2. If done and all tools/goals are accomplished, implement the last 3 functions for Lpr1


Support profiling: add -pg flags to 
                   add target to run gprof on main and put output in 

Edit the existing coverage target to take the terminal output and put at top of .txt file:
  -should look like: gcov -src.c > filename.txt
                     cat rsc.c.gcov >> filename.txt
